      Web design involves creating visually appealing and user-friendly websites
      through graphic design, user experience considerations, and responsive
      design techniques. Designers create layouts, prototypes, and collaborate
      with developers to ensure seamless and accessible user experiences.
      Continuous learning is essential in this rapidly evolving field to stay
      updated with design trends and technologies.
